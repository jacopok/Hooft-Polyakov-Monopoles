In this work we show the fundamental steps of the approaches by Dirac and by 't Hooft and Polyakov to the theory of magnetic monopoles.
In the former, the invariance under duality of Maxwell's equations is postulated and the quantization of electric and magnetic charge is deduced; in the latter an \emph{ansatz} for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Georgi-Glashow model 
is found to provide a regular solution which has magnetic charge quantized according to Dirac's condition.
