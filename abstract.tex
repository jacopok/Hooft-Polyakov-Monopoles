In this work we show the fundamental steps of the approaches by Dirac and by 't Hooft and Polyakov to the theory of magnetic monopoles.
In the former, the invariance under duality of the Maxwell equations is postulated and the quantization of charge is deduced; in the latter an \emph{ansatz} for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Georgi-Glashow model 
% --- a nonabelian SU(2) gauge theory with a Higgs mechanism --- 
is found to provide a regular solution which has magnetic charge, quantized according to Dirac's condition.

% deducing charge quantization for electromagnetism and generalizing the approach per non abelian gauge theories under Higgs mechanism.
