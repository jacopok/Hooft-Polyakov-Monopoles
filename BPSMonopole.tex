\section{BPS Monopole}

We wish to estimate the mass (or, equivalently, energy) of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole: in general, the mass of a dyon be given by the integral
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:monopole-mass}
  E = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}
  \frac{1}{2} \qty(E_i^a E_i^a + B_i^a B_i^a + D_\mu \phi^a D_\mu \phi^a) + V(\phi)\,.
\end{equation}
%
where \(G_{0i}^a = E_i^a\) and \(G_{ij}^a = B_i^a\).

Now, we will derive a lower bound for this mass. Then, we will explicitly show that this bound can be reached by a specific solution: the BPS monopole.

\subsection{The Bogomol'nyi Bound}

First of all we drop the (always positive) terms \(D_0 \phi^a D_0 \phi^a\) and \(V(\phi)\).
Then, we apply the famous ``squaring trick'': we add and subtract some terms depending on a generic angle \(\theta\):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    E \geq \frac{1}{2}  \int_{\mathbb R^3}   E_i^a E_i^a + B_i^a B_i^a + D_i \phi^a D_i \phi^a &+2 E_i^a D_i \phi^a \sin \theta - 2E_i^a D_i \phi^a \sin \theta \\
  &+2 B_i^a D_i \phi^a \cos \theta - 2 B_i^a D_i \phi^a \cos \theta \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
and then we make them into squares, which we can discard while still maintaining the bound:
%

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    E \geq  \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb R^3}
    &\qty(E_i^a E_i^a - 2 E_i^a D_i\phi^a \sin\theta + D_i\phi^a D_i\phi^a \sin^2\theta) + \\
    + &\qty( B_i^a B_i^a - 2 B_i^a D_i\phi^a \cos\theta + D_i\phi^a D_i\phi^a \cos^2\theta) +  \\
    +&2 E_i^a D_i \phi^a \sin \theta+2 B_i^a D_i \phi^a \cos \theta \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The terms in parentheses are positive, therefore this is just bounded by:
%
\begin{equation}
  E \geq \int_{\mathbb R^3}
  E_i^a D_i \phi^a \sin \theta+ B_i^a D_i \phi^a \cos \theta
\end{equation}
%
for \emph{any} \(\theta\).
Now, we use the following facts: by the Bianchi identities \(D_\mu \,^* G^{\mu\nu, a} = 0\) we have \(D_i B^a_i = 0\), therefore \(B_i^a D_i \phi^a  D_i(B_i^a \phi^a)\).
Also, the equations of motion read \(D_\nu G^{\mu\nu, a} = e \varepsilon_{abc} \phi^c D^\mu \phi^b\). Also, \(D_i G_{0i, a} = D_i E_i^a\).  Therefore:
%
\begin{equation}
  D_i \phi^a E_i^a
  = D_i (\phi ^a E_i^a) - \phi^a D_i E^a_i
  = D_i (\phi ^a E_i^a) - \phi^a e \varepsilon_{abc} \phi^c D^\mu \phi^b
  = D_i (\phi ^a E_i^a)\,.
\end{equation}

With these two facts we can frame all of the integrand as a divergence:
%
\begin{equation}
  E \geq \int_{\mathbb R^3}
  D_i \qty(E_i^a \phi^a \sin \theta+ B_i^a  \phi^a \cos \theta) \dd[3]{x}
\end{equation}
%
and apply Stokes' theorem:
%
\begin{equation}
  E \geq \int_{\Sigma_\infty}
  \phi^a \qty(E_i^a  \sin \theta+ B_i^a   \cos \theta ) \dd{S_i}\,.
\end{equation}

Now, by the boundary conditions on \(\phi\) it will be radially outward and with absolute value \(a\) at infinity: therefore its product with the electric and magnetic fields (which are also radial at infinity) reduces to
%
\begin{equation}
  E \geq a (q\sin \theta + g \cos \theta)\,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(q\) and \(g\) are the electric and magnetic charges.
The sharpest bound occurs when the \((q, g)\) and \((\sin \theta, \cos \theta)\)  2D vectors are aligned, and corresponds to their euclidean scalar product: the final bound we get is thus found by the saturation of the Cauchy-Shwarz inequality: \(E \geq a \sqrt{q^2 + g^2} \).

In the 't Hooft-Polyakov case, this simplifies to \(E \geq a \abs{g} \).

\subsection{Saturation of the Bogomol'nyi Bound}

A state which attains the lower bound is called a Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield --- for short BPS --- monopole.

To derive the bound we discarded in the expression of the energy integrals of always-positive quantities, so to reach the bound they must be assumed to vanish everywhere. In addition, we assume our solution to be static. This yields the conditions:
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  V(\phi) &= 0 \label{eq:potential-condition}   \\
  D_0 \phi^a &= 0  \\
  E_i^a &= 0  \\
  B_i^a &= \pm D_i \phi^a  \label{eq:bogomolnyi-condition} \,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now, we make an interesting observation: if \(\lambda \neq 0\) in condition \eqref{eq:potential-condition} we must have that \(\phi^a \phi^a = a^2\) everywhere: therefore \(D_i (\phi^a \phi^a) = 2 \phi^a D_i \phi^a = 0\), and an analogous equation holds with \(D_i \rightarrow \partial_i\).
However, we also have equation \eqref{eq:bogomolnyi-condition}: using it we can also derive \(\phi^a D_i \phi^a \propto \phi^a B_i^a = 0\).

If we insert the 't Hooft-Polyakov \emph{ansatz} in the Bogomol'nyi condition \eqref{eq:bogomolnyi-condition} we get the following set of differential equations:
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \xi \dv{K}{\xi}  &=  -KH   \\
  \xi \dv{H}{\xi} &= -K^2 + H + 1 \,:
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

these can be solved analytically, when coupled to the regular monopole equations of motion.
